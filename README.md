# Spotipy-Time-Machine
Spotipy Time Machine is a Python app that creates Spotify playlists from past Billboard charts. Users enter a date, and the app scrapes song data, searches tracks on Spotify, and builds a private playlistâ€”all through a sleek Tkinter interface with real-time feedback and smart error handling.
