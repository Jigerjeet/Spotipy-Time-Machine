# Spotipy-Time-Machine
Spotipy Time Machine is a Python-based desktop application that lets users relive musical moments from the past by generating Spotify playlists based on historical Billboard Hot 100 charts. Built with Tkinter for the GUI, the app prompts users to enter a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD, then uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape Billboard’s website for the top songs from that day. It authenticates with Spotify via Spotipy and OAuth, searches for each track, and compiles them into a private playlist on the user’s account. The interface provides real-time feedback, error handling, and quick access to Spotify, all wrapped in a visually branded experience inspired by Spotify’s design language. This project combines web scraping, API integration, and UX principles to deliver a nostalgic, interactive music journey.
